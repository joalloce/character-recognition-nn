# Letter Recognition using Neural Network 

(WIP)

Neural Network the recognizes the first 10 capital consonant letters of the alphabet.
The letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K L and M.

It uses the following technologies:

- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

# Setup
To train a new neural network
```sh
python main.py start
```
To continue the neural network training. Training started needed. (W1.txt, W2.txt, numIterations.txt in tmp/ folder)
```sh
python main.py start
```
To test the neural network.Training started needed. (W1.txt, W2.txt, numIterations.txt in tmp/ folder). Results are getting better after 50 iterations or so.
```sh
python main.py test
```
